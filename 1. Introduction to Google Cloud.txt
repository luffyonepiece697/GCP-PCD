 Summary
==================

* Google Cloud offerings can be broadly categorized as :-

  1. Compute

  2. Storage

  3. Big Data

  4. Machine Learning

  5. Application Services (for web, mobile, analytics and back-end solutions)

* Seven Key Learning Objectives are :-

1. Identify the purpose and value of Google Cloud products and services.
2. Define how infrastructure is organized and controlled in Google Cloud.
3. Explain how to create a basic infrastructure in Google Cloud.
4. Select and use Google Cloud storage options.
5. Describe the purpose and value of Google Kubernetes Engine.
6. Identify the use cases for serverless Google Cloud services.
7. And combine Google Cloud knowledge with prompt engineering to improve Gemini responses.

================
Cloud Computing
================

* Cloud Computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits.

1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service. Through a web interface, users get the processing power, storage, and network
   they require without the need for human intervention.

2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere they have a connection.

3. The cloud provider has a big pool of those resources and allocates them to users out of that pool. That allows the provider to buy in bulk and
   pass the savings on to the customers. Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources.

4. The resources are elastic–which means they’re flexible, so customers can be. If customers need more resources they can get more, and quickly.
   If they need less, they can scale back.

5. Customers pay only for what they use, or reserve as they go. If they stop using resources, they stop paying.

====================
IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
====================

* The move to virtualized data centers introduced customers to two new types of offerings: infrastructure as a service, commonly referred to as IaaS,
and platform as a service, or PaaS.

--------
1. IaaS
-------*
  
* IaaS offerings provide raw compute, storage, and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers.
* Compute Engine is an example of a Google Cloud IaaS service.
* In the IaaS model, customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time.

--------
2. PaaS
--------

* PaaS offerings, in contrast, bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure application needs.
* This allows more resources to be focused on application logic.
* App Engine is an example of a Google Cloud PaaS service.
* In the PaaS model, customers pay for the resources they actually use.
* As cloud computing has evolved, the momentum has shifted toward managed infrastructure and managed services.
* Leveraging managed resources and services allows companies to concentrate more on their business goals and spend less time and
  money on creating and maintaining their technical infrastructure.
* It allows companies to deliver products and services to their customers more quickly and reliably.
* Serverless is yet another step in the evolution of cloud computing.
* It allows developers to concentrate on their code, rather than on server configuration, by eliminating the need for any infrastructure management.
* Serverless technologies offered by Google include Cloud Run, which allows customers to deploy their containerized microservices
  based application in a fully-managed environment, and Cloud Run functions, which manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service.

--------
3. SaaS
--------

* SaaS provides the entire application stack, delivering an entire cloud-based application that customers can access and use.
* Software as a Service applications are not installed on your local computer.
* Instead, they run in the cloud as a service and are consumed directly over the internet by end users.
* Popular Google applications such as Gmail, Docs, and Drive, that are a part of Google Workspace, are all examples of SaaS.

===========================
The Google Cloud Network
===========================

* Google Cloud runs on Google’s own global network.
* This network is designed to give customers the highest possible throughput and lowest possible latencies for their applications by
  leveraging more than 100 content caching nodes worldwide.
* These are locations where high demand content is cached for quicker access, allowing applications to respond to user requests from the
  location that will provide the quickest response time.
* Google Cloud’s infrastructure is based in seven major geographic locations: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia.
* Having multiple service locations is important because choosing where to locate applications affects qualities like availability, durability, and latency,
  the latter of which measures the time a packet of information takes to travel from its source to its destination.
* Each of these locations is divided into several different regions and zones.

Region :- Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones.

Zone :- A zone is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed.

* For example, if you launch a virtual machine using Compute Engine it will run in the zone that you specify to ensure resource redundancy.
* You can run also resources in different regions. This is useful for bringing applications closer to users around the world, and also for protection
  in case there are issues with an entire region, such as a natural disaster.
* Some of Google Cloud’s services support placing resources in what we call a multi-region.
* For example, Spanner multi-region configurations allow you to replicate the database's data not just in multiple zones, but in multiple zones
  across multiple regions, as defined by the instance configuration.
* These additional replicas enable you to read data with low latency from multiple locations close to or within the regions in the configuration,
  like The Netherlands, and Belgium.
* The number of zones and regions Google Cloud supports is increasing all the time.
